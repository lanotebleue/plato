# plato


This project is a simple exploration of works by Plato.

The goal of the exploration is theoretically to analyze Plato's works to find the one that is most similar to "The Symposium." However, more than that, the goal is to exhibit basic capabilities of a text analysis using nltk and spaCy.

All texts were downloaded from the source below and underwent some cleaning before use in this project.
